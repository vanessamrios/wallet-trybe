# Wallet Project :dollar:


https://wallet-trybe.vercel.app/

- This project, carried out during the Frontend module of Trybe's software development course, implements a tool for controlling expenses with a currency converter. When using this application, a user, **after logging in**, should be able to:

   - Add, remove and edit an expense;
   - View a table with your expenses;
   - View the total expenses converted to a currency of choice;

- The application was developed in `React` and it uses `Redux` as a **state management** tool.

## Technologies used:

- React and Redux

- In this project, the following skills were practiced:

   * Consume and manipulate data directly from an `API`

   * Create a **Redux Store** in `React` apps

   * Create **Redux Reducers** in `React` apps

   * Create **Redux Actions** in `React` apps

   * Create **Redux Dispatchers** in `Redux` in `React` apps

   * **Connect** `Redux` to `React` components

   * Create **asynchronous actions** in your `React` application that makes use of `Redux`.
